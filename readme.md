# 🧮 Web Calculator

A clean and lightweight web-based calculator developed to practice front-end fundamentals
and professional Git workflow management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple calculator application running entirely in the browser.
It was designed as a learning exercise with the following objectives:

- Build a functional calculator using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Apply a structured **Git workflow** with feature branches, merges, and conflict resolution

No external libraries or frameworks are used in this project.

## ⚙️ Features


➕ Addition

Allows users to add two numbers using the + operator

Displays the result after pressing the equals (=) button

➖ Subtraction

Enables subtraction between two values using the - operator

The result is shown immediately after validation

✖️ Multiplication

Supports multiplication using the * operator

Follows the same interaction logic as other operations

🔄 Clear Function

A clear (C) button resets the calculator state

Clears both the display and internal stored values

---

## 🖥️ User Interaction

User input is handled exclusively through on-screen buttons

Only one operation at a time is processed to keep the logic simple and readable

All calculations are performed client-side using JavaScript

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

A single event listener manages all calculator button interactions

Internal state is handled using JavaScript variables and operator flags

The application logic was developed incrementally to ensure clarity and maintainability

---

## 🔀 Development Workflow

The project follows a professional Git workflow:

main
Represents the final and stable version of the project

develop
Used as the integration branch for all features

feature/*
Each calculator functionality was implemented in a dedicated feature branch

The README.md file is intentionally modified across multiple branches to practice
manual conflict resolution during merges.

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

Future enhancements may include:

Division support

Chained arithmetic operations

Improved input validation

Keyboard input support

Enhanced user interface design
