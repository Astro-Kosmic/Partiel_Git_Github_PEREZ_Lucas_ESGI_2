# Web Calculator

## Project Description
This project is a simple web-based calculator developed to practice:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics
- Git workflow with branches
- Commit history and conflict resolution

At this stage, the project focuses on building the user interface and setting up the project structure.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`  
  Defines the calculator structure and layout.

- `style.css`  
  Handles the visual styling of the calculator.

- `calculator.js`  
  Contains the JavaScript logic (currently minimal).

## Current State
The calculator interface is fully displayed in the browser.
Buttons are clickable and detected using JavaScript event listeners.
Each button click is logged in the browser console for testing purposes.

No calculation logic has been implemented yet.

## Next Steps
Future development will include:
- Displaying user input on the screen
- Handling arithmetic operations
- Computing and displaying calculation results
